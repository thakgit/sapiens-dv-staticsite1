            My CORN Pakoda Recipe :
            <ol><li>This recipe is best made with frozen corn. Coarsely grind frozen corn. Make sure it&#8217;s not gound to a paste.</li><li> Add grated carrots, chopped capsicum, and green chillies. You can add any veggies of your choice. Just make sure the veggies are finely chopped/grated so that they bind together and do not fall apart.</li><li> Now ad the seasoning- black pepper powder, salt and chaat masala</li><li> Mix them all together and let it rest for 5-7 mins. If the temperature is warm, let it rest for a shorter time.</li><li>Resting will allow the corn to defrost a little bit, releasing enough moisture to bind the cutlet together.  </li><li> Now add the corn flour nd rice flour. Rice flour adds crispinedd to the pakodas . If you don&#8217;t have rice flour, you can add maida but it will nnot give the same texture.</li><li>Shape the pakodas/cutlets in your desired shape.</li><li>Fry on medium heat until golden.</li><li>Enjoy with a hot cup of tea or coffee. </li></ol>
