            <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
            <ul><li>Maida/all purpose flour &#8211; 2 cups</li><li>Oil &#8211; 4 tbsp</li><li>Ajwain(onion seeds) &#8211; 1 tsp</li><li>Dried Kasuri methi &#8211; 1 tsp</li><li>Kalonji (caraway seeds) &#8211; 1 tsp</li><li>Water &#8211; 1/2 cup</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li>Oil for frying</li></ul>
            <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
            <ol><li>Take maida in a bowl and add oil to it. </li><li>Rub maida and oil together until they start binding together. To check if your maida is mixed well, pick a handful of maida and make a fist. If the maida forma a ball/stays together and does not crumble, then you have enough oil for your namak para in the maida to make it crunchy.</li><li>Now add salt, crushed kasuri methi, ajwain (caraway seeds) and kalonji (onion seeds) and mix well.</li><li>Add water gradually and form a smooth, tight dough. It is important that you knead the dough well for about 4-5 mins.</li><li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15 mins.</li><li>After 15 mins, take a small ball of the dough and roll it like chapatis. The thickness should be appx. double that of chapati.</li><li>Cut the rolled dough into strips horizontally and then cut across the strips to get small rectangles of namak paras.</li><li>Heat oil on medium heat, drop a small batch of namak paras, and fry until they turn golden. This takes around 5-6 mins.</li><li>Let them cool down a little. They might feel a little soft right off the oil but will turn crunchy once they cool down.</li><li>Enjoy the namak paras with tea, coffee, or as is. You can also use them in place of papri in papri chaat.</li></ol>
